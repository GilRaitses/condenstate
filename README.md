# condenstate canonical scaffold

This repository root is a condensed orchestration scaffold for two paper programs:

- Paper 1: synapsin phase diagram canon under `.sst/paper1/`
- Paper 2: learning bridge canon under `.sst/paper2/`

Canonical surfaces:

- `.sst` for state
- `.ddb` for deterministic decision registration
- `.meta` for run outputs, figures, and reports

Quick start:

```bash
python3 .sst/tools/lifecycle_guard.py
python3 .ddb/tools/register_sst.py
```

Then follow `.sst/next_agent_boot.md` for read order, write policy, and refusal gates.
