## Abstract

Synapsin, a presynaptic protein essential for synaptic vesicle clustering, undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation to form dynamic condensates that organize neurotransmitter release machinery. Despite extensive experimental characterization, the biophysical parameters governing synapsin phase behavior remain poorly defined. This study presents a comprehensive computational phase diagram for synapsin-like intrinsically disordered regions using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of sticker-spacer polymers.

Phase behavior was systematically mapped across interaction strength ranging from 3 to 15 kBT, temperature from 250 to 340 K, chain valency from 2 to 12 stickers per chain, and concentration from 100 to 500 chains over 109 independent simulations spanning five stages. Simulations reveal that at physiological temperature of 300 K, synapsin's native architecture of approximately four aromatic clusters with interaction strength near 3 to 4 kBT positions the protein just below the phase separation threshold. Phase separation requires either supraphysiological interaction strengths exceeding 10 kBT or increased valency of eight or more stickers per chain.

Valency exerts a stronger influence on the critical interaction strength than previously appreciated. Chains with eight or more stickers undergo phase separation at physiological interaction strength while four-sticker chains remain dispersed. This valency dependence explains why proteins with abundant aromatic residues such as FUS and TDP-43 readily form pathological aggregates while synapsin maintains reversible dynamic condensates.

Phosphorylation is modeled as a dual perturbation that reduces both interaction strength by disrupting aromatic stacking and effective valency by blocking sticker sites. This mechanism quantitatively predicts the experimentally observed dissolution of synapsin condensates upon CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation.

A controlled comparison of two interaction models, sticker-sticker (1-1) and sticker-spacer (1-2) attraction channels, reveals that the choice of attractive pair qualitatively affects bond stress during equilibration while producing comparable equilibrium phase behavior, establishing that the 1-2 model used throughout the main grid is a valid and numerically gentler representation.

These results establish that synapsin operates in a poised regime near the phase boundary, enabling rapid activity-dependent condensation triggered by local concentration increases or dephosphorylation. This computational framework provides testable predictions for how post-translational modifications and mutations alter synapsin phase behavior, with implications for understanding synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration.

## Significance Statement

Synaptic vesicle clustering depends on synapsin's ability to form and dissolve liquid condensates in response to neuronal activity. A systematic computational study of 109 coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations maps the complete phase diagram for synapsin-like polymers, revealing that synapsin's modest number of aromatic sticker residues positions it just below the phase separation threshold. This explains how synapsin condensates remain dynamic and reversible unlike pathological aggregates formed by proteins with higher aromatic content. A controlled comparison of two interaction topologies (sticker-sticker vs. sticker-spacer attraction) validates the model choice and reveals model-specific bond stress signatures. The results predict that phosphorylation dissolves condensates by simultaneously weakening sticker interactions and reducing effective valency, providing a quantitative framework for understanding activity-dependent regulation of presynaptic organization.
