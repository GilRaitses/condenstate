# Work plan

## Sequencing
Paper 1 track starts now and produces canon skeleton plus first evidence slices.
Paper 2 track starts now and produces model_spec plus figure_manifest skeleton and cautious framing notes.
Paper 2 binds to Paper 1 only through evidence_index entries, not through narrative claims.
