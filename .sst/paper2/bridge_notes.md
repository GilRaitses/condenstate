# Paper 2 bridge notes

Paper 2 is framed as a reduced-model plausibility study. The slow state term is treated as a gating proxy and not as a direct claim of synaptic causality.

Workers should bind every model update in `.sst/paper2/model_spec.json` to evidence slices that point at `.meta/runs/paper2/*` outputs before changing claim status.
